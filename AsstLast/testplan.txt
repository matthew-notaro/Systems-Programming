WTFtest first creates separate directories for the client and server (./Client and ./Server) if they do not already exist.

It then moves the WTF executable into ./Client and the WTFServer executable into ./Server.

Fork() is called; if the process is a child, serverDriver() changes the working directory to ./Server and sets up the server.

If the process is the parent, clientDriver() changes the working directory to ./Client, compiles WTFclient.c, and runs various system calls.

The system calls test basic functionality of the client. Specifically, the following cases run:
	- Attempt to create project before configuring ... Output: error message prompting user to configure
	- Configure project ... Output: success message
	- Create two different projects ... Output: success messages
	- Attempt to create project that already exists ... Output: error message indicating project already exists
** Use echo to add files to project directory **
	- Add two files to a project ... Output: success messages
	- Attempt to add file that already exists in project ... Output: error message indicating file already exists
	- Attempt to add file to nonexistent project ... Output: error message indicating project does not exist
	- Remove file from project ... Output: success message
	- Attempt to remove file from nonexistent project ... Output: error message indicating project does not exist
	- Attempt to remove file that does not exist within project ... Output: error message indicating file does not exist
	- Commit projects ... Output: success messages
	- Destroy project ... Output: success message
	- Attempt to destroy nonexistent project ... Output: error message indicating project does not exist
	
At the end of the program, a killall command terminates all processes.
