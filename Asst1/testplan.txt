main:
Tested command-line interface's ability to read flags/file names by entering various correct and incorrect series of flags and files that may or may not exist.
/.fileCompressor -R -b test.txt(exists)         -> Correct
/.fileCompressor -b -R test.txt(exists)         -> Correct
/.fileCompressor -R -b test.txt(not exist)      -> Fatal Error: File does not exist.
/.fileCompressor -R -r test.txt                 -> Invalid flag
/.fileCompressor -b -c test.txt(not exist)      -> Invalid flag
/.fileCompressor -c test.txt HuffmanCodebook    -> Input correct book
/.fileCompressor -c HuffmanCodebook test.txt    -> Correct
/.fileCompressor -R -R test.txt                 -> Operation not specified
/.fileCompressor -c test.txt                    -> Not enough arguments
/.fileCompressor -d test.txt                    -> Not enough arguments


build:
Individually tested functions (BST: insert | Heap: heapify, delete, etc. | Huffman: encode) by passing in correctly formatted parameter data structures 
    and analyzing the result with the intented result. 
Tested a variety of test text files: empty, 


compress:
Tested how 
./fileCompressor -c test.txt HuffmanCodebook		->
./fileCompressor -c test.txt HuffmanCodebook		->
./fileCompressor -c test.txt HuffmanCodebook		->
./fileCompressor -c test.txt HuffmanCodebook		->

decompress:




recursive flag:
First tested recursively reading the names of all of the files in a given directory containing:
testDir
    test1.txt
    test2.txt
    testSubDir
        test3.txt

Then tested:
    /.fileCompressor -R -b testDir(exists)
with easily countable contents of the files and compared the frequencies to the intended frequencies.
