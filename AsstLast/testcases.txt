All testcases assume the client can connect to the server and the client requests project/files/version numbers that exists/doesn't exist depending on the command.
Writing every single one would be redundant.

./WTFserver

Example directory structure before executing any commands:
.
    WTFtest.c  
    WTFserver.c
    WTFclient.c

Upon running the makefile:
.
    WTFtest.c  
    WTFserver.c
    WTFclient.c
    WTF
    WTFserver

Upon running ./WTFtest but before any client/server commands are called (not including .c files from now on):
.
    WTFtest.c  
    WTFserver.c
    WTFclient.c
    WTF
    WTFserver
    WTFtest
    Client - working directory for WTFclient
    Server - working directory for WTFserver

Configure:
    ./WTF configure <IP> <host>
.
    WTF
    WTFserver
    Client
        .configure - contains <IP> and <host>
    Server


Create:
    ./WTF create <project>
    Success:
.
    WTF
    WTFserver
    Client
        .configure
    Server
        <project>
            .Archive
            .History
            .Manifest - contains "0"



Checkout:
    Before:
.
    WTF
    WTFserver
    Client

        <project>
            .Archive
            .History
            .Manifest
            file1
            file2
            subdir1
                file3

    ./WTF create <project>
    After:
.
    WTF
    WTFserver
    Client
				.Manifest
        <project> - ignores .* files
            file1
            file2
            subdir1
                file3
    Server
        <project>
            .Archive

Current Version:

History: similar to update and 1st part of commit since it just transfer a single file with a known name over to the client




Rollback:
    
./Server/
    .Archive
